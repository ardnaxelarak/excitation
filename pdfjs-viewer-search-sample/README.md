# [excitation](../) pdf.js viewer search sample

This sample embeds the default pdf.js web viewer application (as used in the Firefox browser) in an iframe, allowing users to work with excerpts within a powerful PDF reader that enables sophisticated searching.

## Embedding pdf.js

To use this sample you need to clone [pdf.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js) and build it, following the instructions in the project README.

Once you have built the project using `gulp generic` (I used `npx gulp generic`), copy the contents of the `build\generic` folder of that repo into the `public\pdfjs` folder.

### Note for Mac Silicon developers

The project README mentions some issues compiling on Mac Silicon. In my experience I needed to do the following before the project would build:

```zsh
brew install pkg-config python-setuptools pango
npm install
```

One colleague found it was necessary to `npm i canvas@next`

Your mileage may vary.

## Building and running this sample

```zsh
cd pdfjs-viewer-search-sample
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then aim your browser at the indicated VITE dev endpoint, which for me is [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)
