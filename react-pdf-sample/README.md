# [excitation](../) react-pdf sample

This sample uses the [react-pdf]() library which wraps [pdf.js]() in easy-to-use React components.

## Building and running this sample

```zsh
cd react-pdf-sample
npm install
npm run dev
```

This starts the Vite dev server. It needs to be serving from [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) but don't go there. Instead, follow the directions at [local-backend-sample](../local-backend-sample/).
