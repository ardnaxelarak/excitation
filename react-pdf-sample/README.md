# [excitation](../) react-pdf sample

This sample uses the [react-pdf]() library which wraps [pdf.js]() in easy-to-use React components.

```zsh
cd react-pdf-sample
npm install
npm run dev

Then aim your browser at the indicated VITE dev endpoint, which for me is [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)
